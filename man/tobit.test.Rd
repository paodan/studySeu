\title{Differential expression testing using Tobit models}
\usage{
tobit.test(object, cells.1, cells.2, genes.use = NULL, thresh.use = log(2),
  print.bar = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{Seurat object}

\item{cells.1}{Group 1 cells}

\item{cells.2}{Group 2 cells}

\item{genes.use}{Genes to test. Default is to use all genes.}

\item{thresh.use}{Limit testing to genes which show, on average, at least
X-fold difference (log-scale) between the two groups of cells.

Increasing thresh.use speeds up the function, but can miss weaker signals.}

\item{print.bar}{Print a progress bar once expression testing begins (uses pbapply to do this)}
}
\value{
Returns a p-value ranked matrix of putative differentially expressed
genes.
}
\description{
Identifies differentially expressed genes between two groups of cells using
Tobit models, as proposed in Trapnell et al., Nature Biotechnology, 2014
